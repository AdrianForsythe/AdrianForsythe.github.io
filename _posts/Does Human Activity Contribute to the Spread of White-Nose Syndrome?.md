White-nose Syndrome (WNS) is an ongoing fungal epizootic caused by epidermal infections of the fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), affecting multiple bat species in North America and is now considered the deadliest disease affecting any non-human mammal species in history. Emerging sometime around 2006 in New York State, WNS has clonally spread into Eastern Canadian provinces sometime before 2012. Using molecular and genomic markers, we have investigated isolates from the Canadian Maritimes to understand the population dynamics of Pd at the local and regional scales. Our analyses revealed high genotype diversity and a lack of local population structuring; both are consistent with frequent transfers of Pd between caves. Human activity has the potential to influence the spread potential of WNS. Our influence on the transmission of Pd has never been quantitatively measured at bat hibernacula. Here we use online Geocaching records at sampling sites as a proxy for human activity in these areas. Our results suggest that sites with a greater number of unique visitors are correlated with higher genotype diversity at these caves. Considering the impact that humans could have on the spread of WNS, further precautions need to be made to prevent and manage the further spread of WNS.
