[![AdrianForsythe's stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=AdrianForsythe)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

In my PhD I used genomics to study the microbial ecology and population structure of the fungal pathogen, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_.
Currently, I am a PostDoc in the Guschanski Lab (Uppsala University), where my Postdoctoral research focuses on both the ancient and modern microbiomes of wild mammals and identifying antimicrobial resistance factors within these communities. The goal of my research is to ultimately contribute to conservation efforts to curb disruptions to microbial ecosystems.
In general, I am interested in how microbial communities respond to disruptions caused by anthropogenic activity.
