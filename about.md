I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Biology from Trent University and began my MSc degree (Specialization in Astrobiology) in September of 2014.
Since then, the main focus of my research has been on the fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans.
As the agent responsible for White Nose Syndrome in North American bat species, P. destructans is the most devastating zoonotic epidemic of non-human mammals on record, already contributing to  >7 million deaths. my thesis project incorporates the investigation of samples obtained from Eastern Canadian bats. By observing the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in P. destructans, my intent was to determine how White Nose Syndrome has changed since it was first documented in 2006.
