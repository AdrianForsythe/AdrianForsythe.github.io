## Employment

Currently, I am a PostDoc in the Guschanski Lab (Uppsala University), where my research focuses on both the ancient and modern microbiomes of wild mammals and identifying antimicrobial resistance factors within these communities. The goal of my research is to ultimately contribute to conservation efforts to curb disruptions to microbial ecosystems.

## General Interests

In general, most of my work has been focused on the intersection between 'wet' and 'dry' lab work.
I apply my knowledge of ecology and microbiology to address problems using genomic tools. I am particularly interested in pathogens, host-microbe interactions, and anthropogenic influences on microbial communities.

## Research Projects

### PhD

In my PhD I used genomics to study the microbial ecology and population structure of the fungal pathogen, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_. Find more about my thesis [here](/Thesis/).

### Geochaching and WNS

Recently I have been working on a project to use novel data streams to investigate the connection between human activity and the spread of the WNS pathogen in North America.
