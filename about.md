## `whoami`

ðŸ‘‹ I am a microbiologist by training, but most of my research has focused on the genomics of fungal zoonoses, microbiomes of wild animals, and now large transposible elements in fungal genomes.

<p>
I am a Researcher at Uppsala University in the Department of Systematics, where my research focuses on identifying and annotating large repetitive elements in fungal pathogen genomes. I'm a member of the <a href=https://fungage.github.io/>FungAGE Lab</a>, where our research is focused on better understand the incredible plasticity in fungal genomes. Right now, I am working on identifying genes that are involved with the movement and function of some extremely large transposible elements, the <a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac109>Starships</a>.

<p> In my PhD I used genomics to study the microbial ecology and population structure of the fungal pathogen, <it>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</it>. Find more about my thesis <a href=https://adrianforsythe.github.io/posts/2020/09/phdthesis/index.html>here</a>.

### Probiotics for White-Nose Syndrome
<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" markdown="1">
<p>I helped to develop a probiotic treatment for White-Nose Syndrome in bats, which is current undergoing field trials in British Columbia, Canada. I contributed to this project by screening bacterial strains for antifungal activity and optimizing the dosage and delivery system in preparation for field trials. I monitored probiotic levels in the field using quantitative assays. I also processed all genomic data generated from this project.</p>

### Geocaching and WNS
<div style="margin:0 10px 10px 0" markdown="1">
<p>
Recently I have been working on a project to use novel data streams to investigate the connection between human activity and the spread of the WNS pathogen in North America.
