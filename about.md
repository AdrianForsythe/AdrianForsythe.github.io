I use genetic/genomic techniques to study microbial ecology and host/pathogen interactions. In general, I am interested in how microbial communities respond to disruptions from anthropogenic influence. My PhD work concerned population genetics of the fungal pathogen responsible for White-Nose Syndrome in North American bats. Since joining the Guschanski Lab, my Postdoctoral research focuses on both the ancient and modern microbiomes of wild mammals and identifying antimicrobial resistance factors within these communities. The goal of my research is to ultimately contribute to conservation efforts to curb disruptions to microbial ecosystems.
