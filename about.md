## Employment

<img align="right" style="width:200px;" alt="Botanical gardens with a view of the castle" src="images/uppsala.jpg">
 am a PostDoc in the Guschanski Lab (Uppsala University), where my research focuses on both the ancient and modern microbiomes of wild mammals and identifying antimicrobial resistance factors within these communities. The goal of my research is to ultimately contribute to conservation efforts to curb disruptions to microbial ecosystems.

## General Interests

In general, most of my work has been focused on the intersection between 'wet' and 'dry' lab work.
I apply my knowledge of ecology and microbiology to address problems using genomic tools. I am particularly interested in pathogens, host-microbe interactions, and anthropogenic influences on microbial communities.

## Research Projects

### PhD Thesis

<img align="right" style="width:200px;" src="images/aem-cover.png">
In my PhD I used genomics to study the microbial ecology and population structure of the fungal pathogen, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_. Find more about my thesis [here](https://adrianforsythe.github.io/posts/2020/09/phdthesis/index.html).

### Probiotics for White-Nose Syndrome

<img align="right" style="width:200px;" alt="Screening for probiotics to combat WNS" src="images/probiotics.jpg">
I helped to develop a probiotic treatment for White-Nose Syndrome in bats, which is current undergoing field trials in British Columbia, Canada. I contributed to this project by screening bacterial strains for antifungal activity and optimizing the dosage and delivery system in preparation for field trials. I monitored probiotic levels in the field using quantitative assays. I also processed all genomic data generated from this project.

### Geochaching and WNS

<img align="right" style="width:300px;" alt="Movement of users between caves" src="images/users_year.gif">
Recently I have been working on a project to use novel data streams to investigate the connection between human activity and the spread of the WNS pathogen in North America.
